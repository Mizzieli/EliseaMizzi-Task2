      <p class="aboutMeText"> My name is Elisea Mizzi I am a 17-year-old student who is currently studying at MCAST. Currently, I am taking an Advanced Diploma and interactive Media course whilst still studying for A’ level art as a private candidate. I am a hard-working student who likes to challenge myself to become the best version possible. As an example of how hard-working I am, during the summer holidays, I spent my time working as well as studying for an English  A’ level which I was able to complete in a 1-year timeframe. </p>
